# Mario-Animated-Game

A simple and interactive Mario animation built using HTML and CSS. Watch Mario run across the screen with smooth animations, and control the action by hovering over the character to pause the movement. This project is a fun way to explore CSS animations and background manipulation.

## Description
The **Mario-Animated-Game** is a lightweight animation project where Mario runs across the screen using keyframe animations in CSS. The character animation is designed to simulate the iconic Mario running scene, making use of multiple sprites to give a smooth transition effect. Hovering over Mario pauses the animation for an interactive experience.
